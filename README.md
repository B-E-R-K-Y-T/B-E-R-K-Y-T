## Hello! My name is Timofey Kondakov,but everybody calls me "BERKYT". I love programming in python and making games. I will briefly tell you about my path in game development. I'm a level designer. I remember my first game on PS3, that was "Resistance fall of man". I was looking on maps in this game and my breathe goes away. That was one of the steps for my level designer job. I admired everything in game: graphics, level details, characters and weapon design, sounds. Since this time I was studing 3ds MAX. It was very difficult way to study this programm. As a result:I started mapping in different varioties. And thanks to this, I again needed 3ds max to change something in the finished models or add my own. Day in and day out, I practiced and practiced until I came to the result, albeit rather quick by the standards of a professional game dev, which is now. I just like [programming](https://pastebin.com/u/BERKYT) and [art](https://www.artstation.com/berkyt)
